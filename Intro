I've created a modern and user-friendly rental homes application with the following features:

Filtering Options:

Property type filter (1BHK, 2BHK, 3BHK)
Bachelors allowed filter (Yes/No)
Rent range slider with maximum rent filter
Property Cards:

Property image
Title and location
Property type badge
Bachelors allowed indicator
Rent amount with Indian Rupee symbol
UI Features:

Clean and modern design with shadow effects
Responsive grid layout
Professional color scheme
Clear visual hierarchy
User-friendly filters
Empty state handling
Visual Elements:

Used Lucide React icons for consistent styling
High-quality property images from Unsplash
Clear typography and spacing
The app is fully responsive and will work well on both desktop and mobile devices. The filters are easy to use and provide immediate feedback as users make selections.
